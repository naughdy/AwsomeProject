- Creating a Component and using props example named as Image and prop example: It a basic example of creating a component and using is repeatedly to display it with differents props like image and title.
- A number increment and decrement example named as Counter: It shows how we can use state to add and subtract a number and display it on screen.
- A flatlist example named as flatlist: It basically shows how to add a flatlist to the app.
- Example of using bottom tab into stack navigator named as Bottom tab example: It has two tabs just to show how it works.
- Example of using top tab into stack navigator named as Top tab example: It has two tabs just to show how it works.
- Example of using Drawer into stack navigator and then a stack navigator and tab navigator inside the drawer named as Drawer example: If you swipe from left the drawe is opened which as three screens with different content, one has 4 buttons that redirect to another screen using stack, second redirects to tab navigator and third redirects to a screen with input text and diplays the text typed in the iput text using state.
- Example of using one common function named as Color Example: It shows how to use a common function to generate a new color with red,blue and green in flatlist every time the button is pressed.

- Example of scrollable flatlist named as Books: It contains all images in a flatlist and it can be scrolled.
- A very good example for styling, managing state, calculating values named as Calculator: Its an ios calculator that uses user built functions to perform calculations.
- Example for getting data from yelp server name as Restuarant: It gets list of restaurants and its details from the yelp server and displayes it into horizontal flatlist and also redirects to the details screen on item click. (to run this successfully, sign in to yelp and add your secret api key into yelp.js file)
- Example of accesing the json server named as Blogs: Its an example of accessing blog data and adding or deleting blogs from it. Context(a concept similar to redux) is used so that data loads up faster and can be accessed in all files. Use my jsonserver repository for running this.
- One additional example of login screen is present in the code for which you will have to uncomment and comment the given code in App.js and add a button in Home.js: It is a login example where you can sign in and sign up and get redirected to success screen.
